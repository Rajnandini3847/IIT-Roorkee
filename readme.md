# Project Name ---- WODDY 
(your agent for education and learning about new words daily)

# uAgent WordsAPI Integrations Examples 
# Requirements
Our challenge today is to integrate WordsAPI with uAgents.

Woddy is a website which has two user base - !. Learner 2. Teacher
1. *Learner* can search any new word and its all around information about the word like syllable, pronunciation, synonyms, results(parts of speech, types of noun) and examples using that word. It can be randomly generated also.

2. *Teacher* assign daily tasks as a new word to learn along with all the features. the student have to answer it on own first and then match the real solution provided by the agents. This will provide them some daily points.




This repository contains examples of WordsAPI integrations using five agents: ` teacher_agent`, `student_agent` ,`random_word_agent` , `search_word_agent` and  `translate_agent`.

1. `teacher_agent`: This agent assign daily task in form of new words to the students. 

2. `Student_agent`: This agent helps student finding new words daily. This also helps with the pronunciation , syllables, results(part of speech , type of noun and examples) related to the given word.

3. `random_word_agent`: This agent generate randon words which are given as output to the `teacher_agent` (which he can assign) and   the generated word goes into the assigned word of the `Student_agent` .

4. `search_word_agent`: This agent searches any new word of user's choice and provide the informations(pronunciations, syllable , result, synonyms) related to the searched word. 

5. `gemma_agent`: This agent using `hugging_face_API` gives summary and in detail information about the word . 

6. `Translate_agent` : 

## Getting Started ðŸš€

To use these agents, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Obtain API Keys ðŸ”‘

Before running the agents, you need to obtain the required API keys:
 `hugging_faceAPI` :  
 `rapidAPI` : 

#### WordsAPI

1. Visit the RapidAPI website: https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi/
2. If you don't have an account, create one by signing up.
3. Once you are logged in, click on test endpoint and register for API on free-tier.
4. Once done you will see X-RapidAPI-Key in header parameter.


### Step 2: Set API Keys and address in agent scripts

1. Fill in the API Keys in the `random_word_agent` and `search_word_agent` scripts.
2. Fill in the API Keys in the `hugging_faceAPI` in the `gemma.py` file.

### Step 3: Run Project

To run the project and its agents:

```bash
cd src
python main.py 
```


#### Features
1. **Interactive Learning Experience**: Woddy provides a gamified learning experience with daily tasks and engaging activities, fostering active participation and retention.

2. **Comprehensive Word Information**: Unlike some platforms that focus solely on pronunciation, Woddy offers comprehensive word information including syllables, synonyms, and usage examples, enriching users' understanding of vocabulary.

3. **uses five- six different agents**: More agents leads to lack of coordination , but it is seems that woddy is better in coordinating.

4. **hugging-face-Api for Text to speech**- The given random word can be pronounced for better understanding of the speech. 

#### Use cases

1. *Student Learning Journey*: Students can explore new words daily, improve pronunciation, and deepen their understanding of language nuances.
2. *Teacher-Student Interaction*: Teachers assign daily tasks to students, monitor their progress, and provide feedback to facilitate continuous learning.
3. *Language Skill Enhancement*: Woddy serves as a valuable tool for enhancing language skills, aiding users in becoming effective communicators.
4. *Engaging Learning Activities*: The platform offers engaging learning activities such as games and quizzes to make the learning process fun and interactive.


### Competitiors
1. **Vocabify**: A similar platform offering word-learning features, quizzes, and interactive exercises.
2. **WordMaster**: Another word-learning app with a focus on vocabulary building and language enhancement.

# Why this 
Comprehensive Word Information: Woddy provides users with comprehensive word information, including syllables, pronunciation, synonyms, parts of speech, types of nouns, and usage examples. This depth of detail sets Woddy apart, offering users a richer learning experience compared to competitors in the market. 

### Future Scope & limitations 
Due to the restrictions of using the given structure only in the fetch AI problem statement, it is needed to keep up with the labled stucture and not integrate any GUI in the product for the evaluation. 
Though, we can present it as a complete product with understable pages. Here is the example of the UI/ UX we have completed for now. 


Now you have the agents up and running to perform a learning platform integrations using the provided APIs. Happy integrating! ðŸŽ‰
